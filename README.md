# Research Lapwing Features
Research for characteristic features in the calls of the Lapwing based on the British Birdsong Dataset.
Project for research within Master's course Acoustic Systems, third semester

## Challenges in the project:
- [ ] determination of general characteristic features in a set of sounds,
- [ ] determination of patterns in compared signals,
- [ ] identification of differences between bird species,
- [ ] exploration the content of signals and search for melodic patterns,
- [ ] determination the characteristics of the fundamental frequency,
- [ ] comparison of the sound made by the lapwing with the other birds,
- [ ] characterization the spectral features in the calls of the Lapwing.

## Dataset:
Birds use songs and calls of varying length and complexity to attract mates, warn of nearby danger and mark their territory. This dataset contains a recordings of different birdsongs from bird species that can be found in Britain (although the recordings themselves are from many different locations). This is a dataset of bird sound recordings, a specific subset gathered from the Xeno Canto collection to form a balanced dataset across 88 species commonly heard in the United Kingdom. It was originally compiled by Dan Stowell and shared on Archive.org.

The copyright in each audio file is owned by the user who donated the file to Xeno Canto. Please see "birdsong_metadata.tsv" for the full listing, which gives the authors' names and the CC licences applicable for each file. The audio files are encoded as .flac files.
